## Notes

### Lights
Light intensity should be available to set in editor.
A sphere showing light intensity in editor would be good
-The light decals should not be visible in game.
Light Hight should be adjustable

### Rooms
Room should have a ambient light level, so that a room could be dark, or even totaly black
(this could be an interesting puzzle or require a light)
Low Room lighting would allow for much more interesting effects

### Bugs
The computer is off the ground by 1 block? the computer is 2 blocks high I don't know if this is why.
The scale of the block in blender is 1 


### Ojbects and positioning

A fairly major change would be that blocks could be placed a hights, eg, 2 off the ground.
This would mean the player can go under things.
And that an object could be ontop of a block (or the table ojejects)
